### Move in linux

`cd`, for Change Directory allows you to move easily and quickly across directories in your system.

> Ok Linux. I want to go to my pictures directory

    cd ~/Pictures

> Ok, now I want to go back home

    cd

> Good, and if I want to move up one directory

    cd ..

> Nice. I want to return to the last directory I was before, possible?

    cd -

> Awesome! Thanks.

Don't forget to use the tab key `⇥` for auto-completion, it's very useful!

### History master

You type many commands in your terminal, 10, then 100, then 100 000 000 ...
You know that you've typed a super-shinny-powerful command in the past but you can't remember what it was. You're going to discover how to find it back.

+ Up Arrow Key 

    To find the previous commands you've typed, you can use the upper arrow key `↑` (multiple times) and it will show you the history. Press Enter `⏎` when you find what you want.

+ History

    A usefull command in linux is `history`, it allows you to see a list of commands you've done previously.
    You can combine it with grep to find something specific.

        history | grep "myarticle.txt"

    On the left of every commands listed in the history you can see a number. You can use it to execute a specific command.

        ![number]
        !951      # execute the command number 951

+ Ctrl + R

    But if you want to be quicker you have to use `Ctrl + R`.
    It will display "reverse-i-search" and you can type any combination of letters. For example, "myarticle".  
    This will display a match of the most recent command in your history containing "myarticle".
    When you find what you were looking for, press Enter `⏎` to execute the suggested command.

+ Exclamation point or "bang"

    + "bang bang" command

        > I've typed a command that requires privileges but I've forgot to use `sudo`.  
        Any advice?

        Enter `!!` (known as "bang bang") to run the previous command.

            apt-get update
            sudo !!         # will run sudo apt-get update

    + Exclamation point

        > Ok, I have a super-awesome memory and I can remember every commands I've typed. How can I run what I've typed seven commands ago ?

        Easy ! Use `!-[number]`

            !-7

        > I want to find the last command that started with a specific text (e.g. "ls")

        Use `![expression]`

            !ls             # will run ls -la ~/Pictures

        > I want to get the previous command without the first word

        Use `!*`

            cp article.txt ./blog/article.txt
            mv !*         # will run mv article.txt ./blog/article.txt

        > I want to get the first argument of the previous command

        Use `!^`

            cp article.txt ./blog/article.txt
            nano !^         # will run nano article.txt

        > I want to get the last argument of the previous command

        Use `!$`

            cp article.txt ./blog/article.txt
            nano !$         # will run nano ./blog/article.txt

        To go a little bit further you can use all the previous commands with the following syntax:

        `[command]:p` : It prints out the command instead of running it

            !!:p             # prints (but don't execute) nano my-so-long-file-name.txt


> I've seen that the history keeps only my 1000 previous commands. How to (de|in)crease this limit ?

You can change this limit in your `~/.bashrc`. Look at the line with `HISTSIZE=1000` and update it to fit your needs.

If you've written some bad or shameful things in your history you can simply erase it with

    history -c

### Play with jobs

When you execute a script or a command that can take a long time to execute, you can run it as a background job.

Run a process in background by appending an ampersand `&`

    node server.js &

> Wait, wait! I forgot to add the ampersand. I need to kill the process, right?

The answer is : No. You can put the current job to the background without having to kill it.

To do so, you need `Ctrl + Z` to suspend the current job.  
Then, `bg` to run it in background.

> Ok fine, my job is working in the background but how do I see it ?

Simple you can use,

    jobs

Or

    ps

It displays a list of the processes you've launched.

If you want to bring a specific job back to the foreground (because you're nice), simply use `fg`.

    fg %[job-number]

    fg %2

But if you are less emotional then you can kill it without scruples, just use `kill`.

If you've choosen to use `jobs`, you can kill a process by is job-number in the list.

    kill %[job-number]

    kill %2

If you've choosen to use `ps`, you can kill a process by is process id (PID).

    kill [PID]

    kill 1293

To kill the current process you can also use `Ctrl + C`

### Do two things (or more) at once

There is three main differents ways to accomplish that.

1 - use a semicolon `;`

It will execute the command regardless of the result of the previous one.

    ./doSomething.sh ; ./doSomethingElseNoMatterWhatHappened.sh

2 - use a double ampersand `&&`

If you want the second command to be executed only if the first exited with no errors.
    
    git clone git@github.com:requiremind/requiremind.github.io.git requiremind && cd requiremind

3 - use `||`

It will execute the second command only if the first failed

    ./testNuclearWeapon.sh || echo "Hum.. Sorry. Everything is out of control.."

### Shortcuts

> I'm writing a command and suddenly I realize that this isn't what I wanted to type or I've made a typo in the first word. What do I do now?

So this is what you usually do (based on my case):

+ Press Shift key `⇧` and top key `↖`: you're in a terminal, this isn't working..
+ Press the erase key `⌫` to the left of the line: works, but this is boring..

No more wasted time ! Now you can use `Ctrl + U`.   
Simple, easy, perfect !

And if you want to just erase word by word, you can use `Ctrl + W`.

To remove all the line to the right of the cursor position, use `Ctrl + K` (and `Ctrl + Y` to revert if this was a terrible mistake).

To simplify your navigation you can use `Ctrl + A` and `Ctrl + E` to go respectively to the beginning and to the end of the current line.

### Define some alias

Sometimes you're going to face a hard-bad-long-painful-forgettable command. Unless you love the pain to type over and over again the same command, you can use `alias`. The syntax to define one is:

    alias [alias-name]=[command]

If you want your alias to persist across different sessions (close the terminal, reboot, ..) you have to add it to your `~/.bashrc`. So open your bashrc file and look for the `#some more aliases` section. Below this, type all your aliases. For example:

    alias ai='sudo apt-get install'
    alias au='sudo apt-get update'

Save your file. And you're done! Time saved.

### The end

Ok, now you've seen a lot of useful command line tips. Learn them, use them and enjoy them. Take your time and once you're done, use `exit` or `Ctrl + D` to close the console and enjoy real life !

    exit

Later on this blog will come another article based on `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh` to go even further and be more effective.

For informations, this article is based on a bash shell running on Ubuntu. It may be possible that some commands used here doesn't work on your own shell/OS.
